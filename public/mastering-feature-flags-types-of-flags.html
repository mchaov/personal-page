<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/mastering-feature-flags-types-of-feature-flags-b57fa613ce38">&quot;Mastering Feature Flags: Types of Feature Flags,&quot;</a> I explore the diverse types of feature flags, emphasizing their essential role in dynamic software development. Feature flags, or feature toggles, are conditional code segments that enable system behavior modification without direct code changes. I categorize feature flags into four primary types: Release, Experimentation, Operational, and Permission, each serving distinct purposes.</p>
<p>Release flags, also known as release toggles, separate feature deployment from release, allowing engineers to merge code into the main codebase and deploy it without affecting the application&#39;s behavior. Experimentation flags, commonly used in A/B testing, enable exposure of different feature versions to various user groups, crucial for testing and optimizing user experiences. Operational flags manage system behavior during different conditions, instrumental in migrations or during incidents. Permission flags control access to features based on user segmentation, allowing for customized experiences and beta testing.</p>
<p>I also discuss two additional dimensions of feature flags: time (short/long-lived) and scope (user/system-based), which further refine their application. My article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of feature flags, helping teams to enhance their software development lifecycle by offering flexibility, reducing risk, and enabling data-driven decisions.</p>
