# Lessons Learned WebSocketAPI at scale

In ["Lessons Learned: WebSocketAPI at Scale,"](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/lessons-learned-websocketapi-at-scale-604617a54cdb) I delve into the complexities of using WebSocket API in large-scale applications, discussing the various challenges and lessons learned at DraftKings. I begin by explaining the importance of WebSocket for real-time, low-latency communication in diverse applications, from chat services to financial and IoT applications. The article highlights key challenges, including state management, where maintaining client connection states becomes resource-intensive, and load balancing, which is crucial for managing long-lived WebSocket connections.

I address the nuances of network and application security, emphasizing the use of encryption, authentication, and secure protocols like wss://. A significant portion of the discussion revolves around backpressure, where I describe how systems can become overwhelmed by data volumes, and the need for strategies like data compaction, buffering, and message dropping to mitigate this.

The article also explores protocol efficiency, focusing on minimizing bandwidth consumption, reducing latency, and managing overhead. I emphasize the need for efficient communication protocols and the careful handling of WebSocket traffic to ensure optimal performance.

In conclusion, I provide insights into application performance monitoring, underscoring the importance of tracking metrics like latency, packet loss, and resource usage. This comprehensive overview is aimed at helping developers and system architects navigate the challenges of implementing WebSocket APIs effectively in high-scale and high-performance environments.
