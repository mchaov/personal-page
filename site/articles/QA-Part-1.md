# QA Part 1

In ["So, you think you do quality assurance? Part 1: Intro to Quality,"](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/so-you-think-you-do-quality-assurance-part-1-intro-to-quality-55f86f0bb7e0) I explore the concept of quality assurance (QA) in the realm of software development. I start by defining quality assurance as a commitment to excellence and a guarantee of high standards in software. My focus is on two distinct aspects of quality: functional quality, which reflects how well the software meets its design and functional specifications, and non-functional quality, which encompasses the structural attributes of the system like scalability, maintainability, and usability.

I address common misconceptions about QA, emphasizing that it's not just about finding bugs or issues but about ensuring the overall excellence of the software. Quality in software, I argue, is often manifested through aspects like user experience, system responsiveness, and security. To illustrate the importance of comprehensive quality assurance, I use various analogies and examples, making the topic relatable and understandable for a wide audience.

The article is designed to serve as an introductory piece for professionals in software development, whether they are engineers, managers, or part of a QA team. My goal is to highlight the significance of quality assurance in every step of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and to encourage a proactive approach to quality, rather than a reactive one. By doing so, I aim to foster a culture where quality is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of software development.
