# Mastering Feature Flags - The Basics

In ["Mastering Feature Flags: The Basics,"](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/mastering-feature-flags-the-basics-f292e64a4b4b) I explore the critical role of feature flags (or feature toggles) in modern software development. Feature flags are conditional code statements that enable developers to switch features on or off without redeploying the entire application. This mechanism facilitates continuous delivery, allowing integration of code into the main codebase while selectively hiding new or incomplete features from end-users.

The article distinguishes feature flags from remote configurations, noting that while both control system behavior, feature flags are binary (on/off) and typically control access to specific features, whereas remote configurations manage more complex settings like system parameters. I discuss various applications of feature flags, including operational risk management, A/B testing, phased rollouts, and trunk-based development. And I also highlight the appropriate and inappropriate use cases for feature flags.

Significant attention is given to the potential pitfalls of feature flagging, such as increased code and testing complexity, the risk of overuse, and the challenge of managing multiple flags and their interactions. I underscore the importance of a disciplined approach to testing, documentation, and ongoing management to maximize the benefits of feature flags while minimizing risks. The article serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and teams seeking to effectively implement and manage feature flags in their projects.
