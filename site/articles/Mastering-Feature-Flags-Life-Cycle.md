# Mastering Feature Flags - Life Cycle

In ["Mastering Feature Flags: Life Cycle,"](https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/mastering-feature-flags-life-cycle-3303c746d227) I delve into the comprehensive journey of feature flags, from their inception to decommissioning. I begin by discussing the creation stage, where I highlight the importance of documenting objectives, stakeholders, expected results, and developing a detailed testing plan. The article also covers the necessity of a standardized naming convention for clarity and consistency across teams.

I then move to the testing phase, emphasizing validation in controlled environments and verifying interactions with other flags. The deployment stage is crucial, and I advise on configuring the default state of the flag and ensuring application functionality. Upon activation, I stress obtaining necessary approvals and choosing an appropriate rollout strategy.

Monitoring is another critical stage where I suggest closely tracking key performance indicators to assess the flag’s impact. I also touch upon the optional deactivation stage, which may occur due to various reasons like adverse impacts or end-of-life.

The final stages, cleanup and decommissioning, involve removing the flag from the codebase and the management system, respectively. I also advise on archiving the flag’s data and audit log for compliance and historical analysis.

Throughout the article, I emphasize strategic planning, cost considerations, and stakeholder engagement, underscoring that managing the life cycle of a feature flag is not just a technical endeavor but a holistic process involving various team members and disciplines.
